Scripts and code used for my bachelor's thesis

The file textextraction.R is an R script that reads UT Department of English BA theses in PDF format, then cleans them and removes excess text not necessary for my analysis.
Manually checking the texts for any leftover quotes is needed!

POS_tagger.py is a python code that uses NLTK to automatically add part of speech tags to the cleaned up texts.
